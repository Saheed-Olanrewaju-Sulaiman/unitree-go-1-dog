- **Lead Contributor:** [Agwaze Great Osayande](https://github.com/GreatOsa), [Saheeed Olanrewaju Sulaiman](https://github.com/Saheed-Olanrewaju-Sulaiman)

A ROS-integrated Gazebo simulation of the Unitree Go1 quadruped for development, debugging, and validation of robotic behaviors.

---

## 📌 Project Vision

This project exists to provide a safe, reproducible, and simulation-first environment for studying and developing behaviors for the Unitree Go1 quadruped robot.

The long term goal is to build a robust quadruped robotics stack—covering locomotion, sensing, navigation, and autonomy using the Unitree Go1 as a reference platform. This simulation serves as the foundation for validating kinematics, dynamics, sensor integration, and control strategies under controlled conditions.

## 🧱 Scope of This Repository

⚠️ Read this first. This repository focuses strictly on simulation and experimentation, not physical robot deployment.

**This repository includes:**

- A simulation model of the Unitree Go1 quadruped (URDF/SDF, links, joints, and frames)

- Physics-based simulation setup (Gazebo / ROS integration)

<!-- - Basic sensor definitions (e.g. IMU, camera, or LiDAR if present) -->

- Launch files and configuration for running the robot in simulation

**This repository does NOT include:**

- Firmware or low-level motor drivers

- Real hardware calibration or actuator tuning

- Safety-certified control software for physical deployment

- Production-ready autonomy or perception systems

One sentence summary:

> This repository defines how the Unitree Go1 behaves in simulation, not how it operates on real hardware.

## 🏗️ What Is Modeled / Implemented

At its current stage, this project focuses solely on establishing a Gazebo-based simulation environment.

✔ Current Implementation

- A URDF model defining the Unitree Go1’s links, joints, and kinematic structure

- A Gazebo world setup for running and visualizing simulations

<!-- - Basic world elements such as ground plane, lighting, and physics configuration -->

- Launch and configuration files required to spawn the robot in Gazebo

🚧 Not Yet Implemented

- High-fidelity actuator dynamics and motor controllers

- Sensor plugins beyond basic definitions (e.g. vision, LiDAR, advanced IMU)

- ROS control interfaces and gait controllers

- Navigation, perception, or autonomy systems

### ✔ Core Components

- Unitree Go1 URDF model defining links, joints, and coordinate frames

- Gazebo simulation world for spawning and visualizing the robot

- Physics configuration for basic interaction with the environment

- Launch and configuration files for initializing the simulation

## ▶️ How to Use / Run

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
- Gazebo Classic 11 installed
- ROS Humble (with ros_control and gazebo_ros packages)
- Python 3 (for launch and helper scripts)

### Basic Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GreatOsa/unitree-go-1-dog.git
```

```bash
cd unitree-go-1-dog
colcon list
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

```bash
# to open the robot in gazebo

ros2 launch unitreedog_description display.launch.py

```

### Expected Output

- When the simulation is launched successfully:
- Gazebo opens with the Unitree Go1 robot spawned in the world
- The robot appears lying on the ground in its default pose
- The scene includes lighting, a flat ground plane, and basic physics
- The robot is static (no controllers yet), but its links and joints are correctly visualized

> Future updates will enable motion, controllers, and sensors, but currently the output is a stable, well-structured robot ready for further development.
